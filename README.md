### Overview
777 is a western themed slot machine game based on casino gambling machines. I love old western movies and games like Red Dead Redemption so my first web based project had to have western themes!
##### Technology Used:
- HTML5
- CSS
- Javascript

### Analysis of Functionality
#### User Stories

- As a user, I want the ability to "pull a lever" whether it be a gif or animated lever.
- As a user, I want the ability to hear the lever click and start playing a sound for the slots spinning.
- As a user, I want the ability to see three slots spin and stop one at a time with a random result.
- As a user, I want the ability to hear a corresponding sound for a win or a loss.
- As a user, I want the ability to see a message that represents a win or a loss.

#### Overall Design
- Rustic western
- Looks as if it smells like a trashy casino
- Rootin' tootin'
